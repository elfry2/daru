# daru
The perfect terminal--not. It's a script to easily set up the [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) + [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) configuration I use.

The above image shows [kami](https://github.com/elfry2/kami) running on daru.

## Installation
DO NOT EXECUTE anything found on this page or anywhere unless you understand what it does and you are sure that it does only what you want it to do.

To install daru, on most Linux distributions it should suffice to simply execute
```bash
git clone https://github.com/elfry2/daru
cd daru
./install.sh
```

# Usage
daru uses kitty as the terminal emulator. You are expected to have read the [kitty Overview](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/overview/) before using it.

To use daru, launch kitty the way you'd launch any other app.
